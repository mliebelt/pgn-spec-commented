# Research about NAGs

Why is research here necessary? The [section 8.2.4](/pgn-specification.md#824-movetext-nag-numeric-annotation-glyph)
is very short, and just tells us that only 255 NAGs are possible `$0` is not allowed.

> An NAG (Numeric Annotation Glyph) is a movetext element that is used to indicate a simple annotation in a language independent manner.
> An NAG is formed from a dollar sign ("$") with a non-negative decimal integer suffix.
> The non-negative integer must be from zero to 255 in value.
